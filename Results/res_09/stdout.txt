About Me

I am Gilles Ferrero, a senior software engineer and director of engineering specializing in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications for business. With over 28 years of experience in the Software R&D Industry, I have developed numerous solutions for Fortune 500 companies and startups alike.


Expertise

My current R&D works focuses on developing novel approaches to text classification, sentiment analysis, and entity recognition. I hold a Master of Science in Computer Science from Telecom Nancy University in France.


Previous Work

I've successfully implemented NLP solutions across various domains including:
- B2C: Web page filtering classifiers to protect minors on the internet
- Telco: Server based content classifiers for content classification at core network levels
- ECommerce: Chat request classifier/router to support end customers
- Retail: Sentiment & Customer feedback analysis over product recommendations


My Approach

Each project begins with a thorough understanding of the business problem, followed by data exploration and prototype development. I prioritize interpretable models that provide not just accurate predictions, but actionable insights that drive business value.

The analysis presented in this report follows my methodical approach to model development, rigorously testing multiple architectures to identify the optimal solution for your specific use case.

This comparison shows model performance at the CATEGORY+SUBCATEGORY level (both must be correct):
Total execution time: 105.01 seconds
Accuracy - The overall proportion of correct predictions (both true positives and true negatives) over the total number of predictions.
Precision (Positive Predictive Value) - The proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions. Shows how reliable positive classifications are.
Recall (Sensitivity, True Positive Rate) - The proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified. Shows how well the classifier finds all positive cases.
F1 Score - The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two, especially useful for imbalanced datasets.
Area Under ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) - Measures the classifier's ability to discriminate between classes across various thresholds.
Confusion Matrix - A table showing true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
Specificity (True Negative Rate) - The proportion of actual negatives correctly identified.
False Positive Rate - The proportion of actual negatives incorrectly classified as positive.
Classification Threshold - The decision boundary used to determine class assignment.
Class Distribution - Information about the balance or imbalance of classes in your dataset.
Model Confidence/Probability Scores - The probability estimates for predictions rather than just the final classifications.
Training/Testing Performance Gap - Indicates potential overfitting or underfitting.
Feature Importance - Which features have the greatest impact on classification outcomes.
Cross-Validation Results - Performance metrics across multiple data splits.
Runtime/Inference Speed - How quickly the classifier makes predictions.
